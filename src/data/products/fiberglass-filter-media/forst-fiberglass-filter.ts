  brand: "GTFS",
  description: "Professional-grade fiberglass filter for superior air filtration performance in industrial applications.",
  detailedDescription: "Fiberglass filter media is made of long fiberglass in non-woven way, large ventilation quantity, small resistance, good efficiency of the dust arrestance for the over-spray. It is applied to the superficial spray coating high quality painting-spray filtration, high dust catching for PA-50/60/PA-100, especially suitable for using heat recovery system. Our Fiberglass Air Filter is designed for efficient removal of dust, pollen, and airborne particles from the air. Made from high-quality fiberglass media, this filter offers excellent filtration performance with low resistance, making it ideal for HVAC systems, industrial air purification, and cleanroom environments. It ensures cleaner air, protects equipment, and improves overall indoor air quality. Key features include high filtration efficiency that effectively captures dust, pollen, and other airborne contaminants, low airflow resistance that maintains optimal airflow while reducing energy consumption, durable fiberglass media resistant to moisture and corrosion suitable for various environments, easy installation and replacement available in multiple standard sizes for quick fit, and wide application suitable for HVAC systems, industrial ventilation, paint booths, and cleanrooms. Technical specifications include fiberglass filter media with MERV 4-8 efficiency depending on model, thickness of 10-50mm, customized or standard sizes available, cardboard or metal frame construction, operating temperature range of -10°C to 80°C, and varying airflow capacity per size and model. Applications include HVAC systems, industrial air filtration, paint spray booths, cleanrooms and laboratories, manufacturing facilities, and commercial buildings. Our products feature superior filtration media with stable performance, competitive pricing with consistent quality, custom sizes and specifications available, and professional technical support with comprehensive after-sales service.",
