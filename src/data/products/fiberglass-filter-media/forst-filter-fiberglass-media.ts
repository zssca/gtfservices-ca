  description: "Paint stop spray booth fiberglass filter media with exceptional dust arrestance and temperature resistance capabilities.",
  detailedDescription: "Fiberglass filter media is made of long fiberglass in non-woven way, large ventilation quantity, small resistance, good efficiency of the dust arrestance for the over-spray. It is applied to the superficial spray coating high quality painting-spray filtration, high dust catching for PA-50/60/PA-100, especially suitable for using heat recovery system. This paint stop spray booth fiberglass filter media features high strength fiberglass increasing structure with the windward side in green and the leeward side in white. The low compression performance maintains its outlook, which is completely useful for the filtration fiber to keep the oil mist and the dust. Key characteristics include non-flammability and temperature resistance up to 170°C, with short peaks up to 190°C. The compression packing may save fare and storage in transportation, and after decompression, it will regain its original condition. Available models include SFF/PA-50/60 with Average efficiency average arrestance, 15Pa initial pressure drop, 250Pa final pressure drop, 0.7-1.5m/s air velocity, 3200-3600g/m2 dust holding capacity, and SFF/PA-100 with High average efficiency average arrestance, 20Pa initial pressure drop, 280Pa final pressure drop, 0.7-1.75m/s air velocity, and 3600-3900g/m2 dust holding capacity. Normal thickness ranges from 50/60mm to 100mm with standard sizes available. Main applications include auto electrophoretic paint filters, fire-resistant steel casting plant flue gas dust removal processing systems, and explosion grinding bag dust collectors in blast furnace and cement plants. The product supports customization and is widely used in glass fiber filter applications with good dust capacity, durability, and long service life, particularly suitable for paint room vents, automobile painting industry, and general spraying industry applications.",
