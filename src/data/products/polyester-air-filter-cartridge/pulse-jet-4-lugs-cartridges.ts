  description: "Pulse jet filter cartridges with 4-lug connection system for industrial dust collection. Features imported polyester media with waterproof, oil and anti-static processing for high-dust concentration industries.",
  detailedDescription: "Mainly used in the plasma laser cutting of large-scale steel, shipbuilding, automotive, metal processing industry, welding smoke, thermal spray industry and other special conditions. Product Features: 1) Imported long fiber polyester filter media, fiber interwoven, evenly distributed. 2) Filter material surface do waterproof, oil and antistatic processing. 3) Good abrasion resistance, and the capability of withstand airflow pulse inverse blow is better than traditional filter media. 4) Smooth filter media surface, not sticky. 5) Excellent chemical resistance. 6) Electro-galvanized / stainless steel cover, central skeleton. 7) Professional sealing obturator elastic neoprene. 8) Good filter material stiffness, can be repeated washed. 9) Operating temperature ≤ 135°C. 10) Greatly increase the effective filtration area. 11) Ensure a low steady differential pressure, improve the circulation of air flow. 12) Small filter cartridge element, easy to install. 13) Especially suitable for large dust concentration industry. Material options include aluminum top cap, EPDM or silicone gasket, galvanized steel inner mesh, optional glued or ultrasonic welded straps, galvanized or stainless steel closed bottom cap, and compatible with Nordic Air Filtration's filter media selection.",
