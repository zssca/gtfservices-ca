  description: "Advanced anti-static polyester filter cartridge for plasma cutting, welding, and metal processing industries. Features waterproof, oil-repellent surface treatment with excellent chemical resistance.",
  detailedDescription: "Mainly used in the plasma laser cutting of large-scale steel, shipbuilding, automotive, metal processing industry, welding smoke, thermal spray industry and other special conditions. Product Features: 1) Imported long fiber polyester filter media, fiber interwoven, evenly distributed. 2) Filter material surface do waterproof, oil and antistatic processing. 3) Good abrasion resistance, and the capability of withstand airflow pulse inverse blow is better than traditional filter media. 4) Smooth filter media surface, not sticky. 5) Excellent chemical resistance. 6) Electro-galvanized / stainless steel cover, central skeleton. 7) Professional sealing obturator elastic neoprene. 8) Good filter material stiffness, can be repeated washed. 9) Operating temperature ≤ 135°C. 10) Greatly increase the effective filtration area. 11) Ensure a low steady differential pressure, improve the circulation of air flow. 12) Small filter cartridge element, easy to install. 13) Especially suitable for large dust concentration industry. Material options include galvanized steel top cap, EPDM gasket, galvanized steel inner mesh, glued ultrasonic welding bands, galvanized or stainless steel closed bottom cap, and filter media options including Toray PE, Toray PTFE, PE+PTFE, and PE Antistatic.",
