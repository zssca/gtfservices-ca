  description: "Mobile high-efficiency dust removal solution for localized dust and fume extraction. Features compact structure, strong suction, and multi-stage filtration with up to high-efficiency efficiency.",
  detailedDescription: "The Industrial Portable Extractor Dust Collector is a mobile and high-efficiency dust removal solution designed for localized dust and fume extraction in industrial environments. With its compact structure, strong suction, and multi-stage filtration system, it effectively removes airborne particles, ensuring a clean and safe workspace. This system is ideal for welding stations, grinding rooms, woodworking workshops, and small-scale manufacturing areas. Key Features: Portable Design with Lockable Wheels easily movable between workstations; compact structure fits tight spaces. High Filtration Efficiency with multi-stage filters (including optional HEPA and activated carbon) remove up to high-efficiency of dust and fumes. Flexible Extraction Arm features 360° rotatable suction arm with hood for targeted source capture. Low Noise Operation with quiet performance (≤72 dB), ideal for indoor environments. Energy Efficient Motor with industrial-grade blower with stable airflow and low energy use. Quick Maintenance with easy-access filter compartment and dust bin design. Technical Specifications: Filtration Efficiency ≥high-efficiency (with HEPA filter), Airflow Capacity 600 – 1800 m³/h (customizable), Voltage Options 110V/220V/380V/Customized, Power Consumption 0.75 kW – 3 kW (based on model), Filter Types Pre-filter + HEPA/Carbon/Nano Fiber, Cleaning Method Manual/Pulse Jet (optional), Noise Level ≤72 dB, Extraction Arm Length 1.5 – 3 meters (adjustable), Housing Material Powder-coated steel/Stainless steel, Dimensions Customized, Weight Varies by model. Applications: Welding & Soldering Workstations, Grinding and Polishing Rooms, Laser Cutting or Engraving Areas, Electronics Assembly Lines, Chemical Labs and Cleanrooms, Jewelry and Dental Workshops, Small CNC and Metalworking Stations, Pharmaceutical and Packaging Industries. Why Choose Our Portable Dust Collector: 10+ years of experience in industrial filtration systems, OEM/ODM customization support, Compact design with powerful performance, Certified quality, energy-efficient, and long service life, Trusted by customers in Europe, America, and Asia.",
