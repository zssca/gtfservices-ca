  description: "Compact air filtration device designed to capture dust, smoke, and fine particles directly at the source. Removes up to high-efficiency of airborne particles with flexible extraction arm.",
  detailedDescription: "The Dust Remover Extractor is a compact and powerful air filtration device designed to capture dust, smoke, and fine particles directly at the source. Ideal for industrial workshops, laboratories, welding stations, and production lines, this extractor improves indoor air quality and protects both operators and equipment. Its efficient filtration system, flexible extraction arm, and low-noise performance make it a reliable choice for spot dust control and localized fume removal. Key Features: High-Efficiency Filtration removes up to high-efficiency of airborne particles with HEPA/nano filters. Flexible Extraction Arm features 360° adjustable arm with hood for precise source capture. Portable Design with compact size and caster wheels for easy relocation. Low Noise & Energy Use operates quietly (≤72 dB) and efficiently. Easy Maintenance with front-access filters for quick replacement and cleaning. Plug-and-Play Setup with standard voltage operation—no installation needed. Technical Specifications: Filtration Efficiency up to high-efficiency (with HEPA or Nano Filter), Airflow Capacity 500 – 1800 m³/h (customizable), Voltage 110V/220V/380V (optional), Power Consumption 0.75 – 2.2 kW (based on model), Filter Material Polyester/HEPA/Carbon/Nano Fiber, Cleaning Method Manual or Pulse Jet (optional), Extraction Arm Length 1.5 – 3 meters (adjustable), Noise Level ≤72 dB, Housing Material Powder-Coated Steel, Dimensions Customizable, Weight Depends on model. Applications: Welding & Soldering Stations, Laser Engraving/Cutting, Woodworking and Sawing, Grinding & Polishing Workshops, Electronics & PCB Assembly, Medical & Laboratory Environments, Jewelry and Dental Clinics, Powder Filling/Packing Stations. Why Choose Our Dust Extractor: Factory-direct pricing and fast delivery, OEM/ODM support with customized solutions, 10+ years of industrial filtration experience, Strict QC and CE-certified systems, Trusted by clients in Europe, North America, and Asia.",
