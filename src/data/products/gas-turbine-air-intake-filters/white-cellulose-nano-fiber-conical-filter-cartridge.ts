  description: "Superior dust filtration performance filter cartridge with nano fiber technology and conical design for pulse-jet dust collectors.",
  detailedDescription: "The White Cellulose Nano Fiber Conical Filter Cartridge is designed for superior dust filtration performance in industrial dust collection systems. With advanced nano fiber media laminated onto a cellulose substrate, this filter cartridge delivers high efficiency filtration, capturing fine particulate matter while maintaining excellent airflow and low pressure drop. The conical shape enhances cleaning efficiency, making it ideal for pulse-jet dust collectors. Key features include nano fiber technology with surface-loading nano fibers that improve high-efficiency capture for submicron particles, cellulose base media that is biodegradable and cost-effective with good mechanical strength, conical design that promotes better airflow and facilitates efficient pulse cleaning to extend service life, low pressure drop that maintains strong airflow with less energy consumption, rigid construction with galvanized or stainless steel end caps and inner cores for structural stability, and custom sizes available with diameters, lengths, and sealing options that can be tailored to your equipment. Technical specifications include cellulose + nano fiber filter media, high-efficiency filtration, conical/tapered shape, 325mm customizable outer diameter, 145mm top/66mm bottom customizable inner diameter, 660mm/700mm/custom length, galvanized steel/stainless steel end cap material, expanded metal inner core type, urethane/neoprene/silicone gasket types, and ≤70°C operating temperature for standard cellulose. Applications include industrial dust collection units, sandblasting and shot peening equipment, pharmaceutical and food processing plants, powder coating systems, woodworking and furniture manufacturing, and welding and plasma cutting workstations.",
