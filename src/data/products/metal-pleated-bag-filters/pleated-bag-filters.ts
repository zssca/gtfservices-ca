  detailedDescription: `Metal Pleated Bag Filters

Product Overview
The Pleated Bag Filter is an advanced dust filtration solution designed to increase filter surface area and improve filtration efficiency without changing the size of existing dust collector housings. By replacing traditional filter bags and cages with pleated filter bags, users can achieve longer service life, reduced maintenance, and lower pressure drop. Ideal for retrofit applications in pulse jet, reverse air, and shaker baghouses.

Key Features
• Increased Filter Surface Area: 2–3 times greater filtration area compared to traditional bags
• Efficient Dust Removal: High efficiency High-efficiency
• Direct Retrofit Design: No need to modify existing baghouse systems
• Durable Construction: Heat and chemical resistant materials such as polyester, PPS, aramid, or PTFE
• Stable & Long-Lasting: Pleated structure ensures structural stability and consistent airflow
• Customizable Options: Various lengths, diameters, pleat counts, and end cap styles available
