  description: "Square flange air filter cartridge designed for efficient dust filtration in industrial collectors. Features High-efficiency",
  detailedDescription: "The Square Flange Air Filter Cartridge is designed for efficient dust filtration in industrial dust collectors requiring square or rectangular flange-mounted filters. With high-quality pleated filter media and a precision-engineered square flange, this cartridge ensures reliable sealing, high airflow, and excellent particle capture. It is ideal for use in applications such as powder coating, shot blasting, sanding, welding fumes, and general dust extraction systems. Key Features: Square Flange Mounting ensures secure installation and optimal sealing in square flange housings. High Dust Holding Capacity with pleated filter media increases surface area, reducing maintenance frequency. Low Pressure Drop maintains consistent airflow and energy efficiency across its lifespan. Durable Construction features galvanized steel or stainless steel end caps, expanded metal core, and industrial-grade gasket. Versatile Filter Media Options include polyester, cellulose, nano fiber, anti-static, or flame-retardant. Custom Sizes Supported with tailored height, width, flange size, and pleat count upon request. Technical Specifications: Filter Media Polyester/Cellulose/Nano Fiber/PTFE, Filtration Efficiency High-efficiency, Flange Type Square or Rectangular Mounting Flange, Flange Size 320×320 mm, 350×350 mm, or custom, Length 660 mm/700 mm/Customizable, Outer Diameter 325 mm/350 mm (as applicable), End Cap Material Galvanized or Stainless Steel, Gasket Type Urethane/Rubber/Silicone, Operating Temperature Up to 120°C (standard media), Cleaning Method Pulse Jet/Reverse Air Compatible. Applications: Powder Coating Booths, Shot Blasting and Sanding Systems, Welding and Grinding Dust Extraction, Woodworking and Composite Processing, Chemical and Food Production Facilities, Cement, Mining, and Foundry Industries. Why Choose Our Square Flange Filter Cartridge: Precision flange design for stable mounting and sealing, Wide compatibility with industrial dust collectors, High filtration performance and extended service life, Direct factory supply, fast turnaround, and flexible customization, Trusted by industrial clients across Europe, America, and Southeast Asia.",
